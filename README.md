## Usage 

This gem depends on the loadcss-rails gem.  Per their instructions.

The loadCSS and onloadCSS files will be added to the asset pipeline and available for you to use. Add the lines that you need to your application's JS manifest (usually app/assets/javascripts/application.js).

```
//= require loadCSS
//= require cssrelpreload
//= require onloadCSS
```

Setup critical_path_css.yml per the critical_path_css README

[https://github.com/mudbugmedia/critical-path-css-rails]

Include this gem in your application_controller.rb
```
include CriticalPathCssWorker
```

Add the critical css code to your application.html.haml. In the example below 'path' is the url or path for the current page and the default css file is presumed to be 'application'.
```
<style>
  <%= raw critical_css(path) %>
</style>
<script>
    loadCSS("<%= stylesheet_path('application') %>");
</script>
<link rel="preload" href="<%= stylesheet_path('application') %>" as="style" onload="this.rel='stylesheet'">
<noscript>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="<%= stylesheet_path('application') %>">
</noscript>
```
